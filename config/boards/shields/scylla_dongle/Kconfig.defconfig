      This value is used by some widgets in the prospector_adapter shield.
      It should generally match the value of ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_CENTRAL_PERIPHERALS
      which is set in the main scylla shield's Kconfig.defconfig when
      SHIELD_SCYLLA_DONGLE is active.

# Ensure the main dongle Kconfig settings from the scylla shield are also included.
# This relies on the scylla shield's Kconfig.defconfig being processed,
# which happens if "scylla" is also in the shield list, or if these are duplicated.
# For simplicity and to ensure scylla_dongle can be somewhat standalone for this
# specific Kconfig need, we can re-assert critical dongle settings here if needed,
# or ensure the build system correctly layers Kconfig from multiple shields if "scylla"
# is not the primary shield.
#
# The primary settings like ZMK_SPLIT_ROLE_CENTRAL, ZMK_SPLIT,
# ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_CENTRAL_PERIPHERALS, BT_MAX_CONN, BT_MAX_PAIRED
# are expected to be set by the main 'scylla' shield's Kconfig.defconfig
# when SHIELD_SCYLLA_DONGLE is true. This file primarily serves to provide
# ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_PERIPHERAL_COUNT when scylla_dongle is the first shield
# in the list that provides a Kconfig.defconfig (or if prospector_adapter is first
# and doesn't provide it).
